# Why Notpadd?

Notpadd was created with a simple goal: **make content management faster, simpler, and more predictable**—without sacrificing flexibility.

Traditional CMS platforms often rely on fetching content at runtime, which introduces latency, network dependency, and slower performance. Notpadd solves this by shifting content generation to **build time**, meaning your content is bundled with your app when it’s deployed. No more waiting for an API response just to render a blog post.

## Built for Static Speed

With Notpadd, your content lives inside your codebase as static files. This means:

- **Instant access to content**—no runtime API calls.
- **Improved SEO**—search engines love fast-loading static pages.
- **Fewer moving parts**—you don’t need a separate CMS server to serve content.

It’s perfect for modern frameworks like **Next.js**, **Astro**, and **SvelteKit**, where static generation is a core part of the workflow.

## Flexible, Not Opinionated

Notpadd gives you structure, not restrictions. You decide how your content is shaped, how it's used, and how it’s presented. It works well for:

- Blogs
- Documentation sites (50% to be fully supported)
- Marketing pages (50% to be fully supported)
- Any content-driven frontend (50% to be fully supported)

And it integrates seamlessly with your existing stack—no need to rebuild anything.

## Local-first, Dev-friendly

We believe content management should be just as developer-friendly as your codebase. That’s why Notpadd works locally, with TypeScript support, automatic content typing, and Git versioning by default.

Your team can collaborate on content the same way they collaborate on code—through branches, commits, and pull requests.

---

## One Less Server to Worry About

By removing the need for a runtime CMS backend, Notpadd reduces complexity in your architecture. You don’t have to worry about uptime, API tokens, rate limits, or client-side fetching. Everything is generated when you build.

It’s fast, it’s stable, and it scales.

## When Should You Use Notpadd?

You should consider Notpadd if:

- You want **fast, SEO-friendly** content pages
- You’re tired of CMS dashboards and slow API calls
- You value a **Git-based, code-first** content workflow
- You’re building with **Next.js**, **Astro**, **SvelteKit**, or any SSG framework
- You want to manage content with full developer control
