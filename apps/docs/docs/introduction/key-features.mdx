# Key Features

Notpadd is designed to give you a high-performance content workflow without the complexity of traditional CMS platforms. Here’s what makes it stand out:

## Blazing Fast Build-Time Content

No runtime fetching, no delays. Content is bundled directly into your project during the build process for instant page loads and improved SEO.

## Secure by Default

Public and private environment keys are scoped and only available where they’re needed—keeping your app safe without extra effort.

## Fully Customizable

Tailor everything—from content structure to access rules. Notpadd is flexible enough to fit any workflow or project size.

## Developer-First DX

Built with TypeScript and modern tooling in mind, Notpadd offers a clean API and strong type safety out of the box—so you can move fast and break nothing.

## Collaboration-Ready

Add teammates, assign roles, and manage access easily. Whether you're working solo or with a team, Notpadd is built to scale with your workflow.

## Works in Dev and Prod

No more "it only works locally." Notpadd ensures consistency across environments, so what works in development works in production too.
