title: Getting Started
summary: Set up Notpadd in minutes and start generating content at build time.
---

# Getting Started

Notpadd helps you manage content with the performance and simplicity of static generation. This guide will walk you through setting it up in your project.

---

## 1. Install Notpadd

Start by installing Notpadd via your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install notpadd
# or
pnpm add notpadd
# or
yarn add notpadd
```

---

## 2. Configure Notpadd

Create a `notpadd.config.js` file in the root of your project:

```ts
// notpadd.config.js
import { createNotpaddConfig } from "notpadd"

export const notpadd = async () =>
  await createNotpaddConfig({
    publicKey: process.env.NOTPADD_PUBLIC_KEY,
    secreteKey: process.env.NOTPADD_SECRET_KEY,
    publishOnly: true, // or false if you want to fetch only published content
  })
```

This tells Notpadd where to fetch your content and where to store it in your project. The output directory will be populated at build time.

---

## 3. Generate Content

Run the content generator to pull in your data:

```bash
npx notpadd generate
```

This will fetch your content and write it to the configured output directory. You can now import and use this data in your app without making runtime requests.

---

## 4. Use the Content

Assuming your output path is `content`, you can import your content like this:

```ts
import posts from "../content/posts"

export default function Blog() {
  return (
    <div>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <article key={post.id}>
          <h2>{post.title}</h2>
          <p>{post.summary}</p>
        </article>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Your data is now available staticallyâ€”no network requests, just pure speed.

---

## 5. Automate It

To ensure content is always up to date, add the generation step to your build script:

```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "notpadd generate && next build"
  }
}
```

Now every build will include the latest content.
