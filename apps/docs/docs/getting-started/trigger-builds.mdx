# Auto Trigger Builds

Notpadd automatically triggers builds when you Change the status of an article from either "Published", to "Archieved" or "Draft" to keep your content up to date.

## How it works

Notpadd utilizes spaces where a space represents a project (github repository). When you change your article status, it will trigger a new commit to your repository, that will trigger your deployment provider like Vercel, Netlify, etc... to build your content or your site and then deploy it. (This is not a realtime process, it will take a few seconds to minutes to build and deploy your content.)

## How to enable it

1. Create a new file in your repository called `do_not_edit_this_file.md`. this is the file that notpadd will use to trigger your deployment provider and keep it empty.

2. select a team > space on your dashboard and click on the "Credentials" button and fill in the following fields:

- **Repository name**: the name of your repository.
- **Github token**: a github token to secure your webhook and if your repository is private, you need to create a personal access token and add it here.

or you can follow via the images below:

- Step 1:
  <Frame>
    <Image src="/step-one.png" alt="Auto Trigger Builds" />
  </Frame>
- Step 2:
  <Frame>
    <Image src="/step-two.png" alt="Auto Trigger Builds" />
  </Frame>

3. Click on the "Update" button and you're done.

And voila! you're done. Now when you change the status of an article, it will trigger a new commit to your repository, that will trigger your deployment provider to build and deploy your content.
